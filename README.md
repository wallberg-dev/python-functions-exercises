Python exercises focused on functions and modular problem solving (UBA – Computational Thinking Guide 4)

# Guide 4 – Functions and Problem Solving  
University of Buenos Aires – Introduction to Computational Thinking

This repository contains my solutions for Guide 4 from the course *Introduction to Computational Thinking* at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA).

## Topics Covered

- Function creation and reuse
- Parameterized logic
- Return values
- Modular design
- Structured problem solving using reusable components
- Logic exercises modeled through functions

All exercises are documented with the original instructions as comments inside the `GUIA4.py` file.

## Personal Note

This project is part of my academic development as a Computer Engineering student. I'm currently focusing on strengthening my Python foundations through structured exercises and will continue adding more challenges, including LeetCode problems and personal projects.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the file `GUIA4.py`.
2. Open it using a Python-friendly editor (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).
3. Explore each function independently; most exercises are self-contained and ready for testing.
4. Uncomment examples if you'd like to run them locally.
